# harmlessviruses
harmless viruses is a large library of harmless windows pranks. all of these are either .exe, .vbs or .bat files. it gets updated frequently with new viruses ("viruses").
# Reliability
to make sure we have as many assets as possible, we do not debug unless enough people want us to fix a specific asset.
# NOTE
we are NOT accountable for use for the worser worse. some of these might make the user restart the computer (unless they know how to use task manager with .vbs files!).
